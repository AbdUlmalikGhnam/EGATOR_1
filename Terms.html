            “Terms and Conditions” is the document governing the contractual
            relationship between the provider of a service and its user <span>.</span> On the web,
            this document is often also called “Terms of Service”<span>,</span> “Terms of Use“<span>,</span>
            EULA<span>,</span> “General Conditions” or “Legal Notes <span>.</span>

        <h3>In B2C transactions <span>:</span></h3>

        <h4>
          <span>1_</span> The standard terms and conditions must be written in such a way that consumers can understand
          them <span>.</span>
        </h4>
        <h4>
          <span>2_</span> so-called ‘transparency requirement’<span>,</span> a person who has no legal background must
          be able to understand the terms <span>.</span>
        </h4>
        <h4>
          <span>3_</span> The terms must be legible <span>.</span>Things to consider here include: the size of the
          writing and a clear structure <span>.</span> A
          consumer must be able to take note of the terms without undue difficulty <span>.</span>
        </h4>
        <h4><span>4_</span> It must be obvious to the consumer that the standard terms are incorporated into the
          contract <span>.</span></h4>
        <h4>
          <span>5_</span> business must draw the consumer’s attention the standard business terms at the time of the
          contract is
          concluded <span>.</span>
        </h4>
        <h4><span>6_</span> The standard terms cannot be incorporated into the contract after the contract has been
          entered into <span>.</span></h4>
        <h4>
          <span>7_</span> practice this means that standard terms of business that are printed on the back of a contract
          are not
          incorporated into the contract unless there is notification on the front of the document that they apply
          <span>.</span>
        </h4>

        <p>
          Standard terms and conditions printed on the back of invoices or receipts also remain ineffective for lack
          of
          incorporation <span>.</span>
          Where a large number of transactions are conducted or where it is unreasonably difficult<span>,</span> due to
          the type of
          contract being concluded<span>,</span> to draw attention to the standard terms<span>,</span> it is sufficient
          for them to be displayed
          on
          a notice at the place where the contract is being concluded<span>,</span> provided the notice is clearly
          visible <span>.</span>This is
          the
          case in car parks or in sport centres <span>.</span>
        </p>
        <h4>In B2B transactions <span>:</span></h4>
        <p>
          The rules on the incorporation of standard business terms are less strict in business-to-business
          transactions <span>.</span>
          For the standard terms to be incorporated<span>,</span> it is sufficient that the intention to incorporate
          them was clear
          to
          the other party and that the other party does not object to their incorporation <span>.</span> The other party
          must simply
          be
          placed in a position to obtain knowledge of the standard business terms without undue difficulty
          <span>.</span>
          Where both parties make use of standard terms<span>,</span> only those terms that have been explicitly agreed
          by the
          parties
          apply <span>.</span>If there are contradictory terms<span>,</span> the corresponding statutory provisions
          apply in their place <span>.</span>
